# Introduction

There are 3 code examples in this folder. `EC2_to_S3.py` and `S3_to_EC2.py` are examples of file transfer between an S3 bucket and EC2 instance using multi-threading to speed up the procedure. Lastly, and optimized option using Dask is presented.

## Why use multi-threading to copy files between S3 and EC2?

Multi-threading improves the copy performance between S3 and EC2 because it allows the script to download multiple files simultaneously. When a file is downloaded, it takes some time for the file to be transferred over the network from S3 to EC2. During this time, the thread that initiated the download is waiting for the file to be transferred, and the CPU is not doing any other work. By using multi-threading, the script can initiate multiple file downloads simultaneously, so while one thread is waiting for a file to be transferred, another thread can begin downloading a different file. This allows the script to make more efficient use of the available CPU resources, which can result in faster download times. Additionally, the concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor class is a convenient way to manage the threads and ensure that they are properly started and joined, which simplifies the code and makes it easier to reason about.

## Why transferring files?

The need to move files from S3 to EC2 to process them arises in situations where it is not feasible or efficient to process the files directly in S3. This may be due to network latency, high data transfer costs, or limited computational resources in the S3 environment. To overcome these limitations, it is often necessary to copy the files to a local or remote EC2 instance for processing.

However, copying large numbers of files from S3 to EC2 can be time-consuming and resource-intensive, especially if the files are large or there are many of them. To speed up the process, it is common to use multi-threading or other parallel processing techniques to download and process the files in parallel.

The Dask approach described above offers an alternative way to process the files that can potentially reduce the time, cost, and complexity of the file transfer process. This is because Dask can use its built-in S3 file system to directly access and read the files in S3, without the need to download them to the local machine first. This can save time and storage space, especially for large files or large numbers of files.

In addition, Dask can parallelize the file processing across multiple workers, using its task scheduler and task graph to efficiently distribute and manage the processing tasks. This can improve the overall processing time and resource utilization, especially when processing large or complex data sets.

Using Dask in this way can potentially lower the cost and complexity of the data transfer and processing process, as it reduces the need for intermediate file storage and reduces the amount of data that needs to be transferred. It also provides a more scalable and efficient way to process large or complex data sets in a distributed environment, which can help to improve the speed and accuracy of the processing tasks.

## How Dask works?

Dask can be used to optimize this code by providing a more scalable and efficient way of downloading and processing the files from S3. One way to do this is to use Dask's bag or dataframe API to parallelize the file download and processing tasks across multiple workers, and to use Dask's built-in S3 file system to directly access and read the files from S3 without the need to download them locally.

Using Dask in this way provides a number of benefits over the original code:

- Dask automatically parallelizes the file processing across multiple workers, which can improve the overall processing time and resource utilization.
- Dask's S3 file system allows direct access to the files in S3, without the need to download them locally first. This can save time and storage space, especially for large files or large numbers of files.
- Dask's built-in scheduler and task graph allow efficient load balancing and fault tolerance, ensuring that the processing tasks are evenly distributed and can recover from worker failures.

For the example code (`S3_process_dask.py`):

To use this code, save it in a file (e.g. `process_s3_files.py`) and run it from the command line using the following arguments:


python process_s3_files.py -bucket my-bucket -prefix my-prefix -max_workers 4


where `my-bucket` is the name of the S3 bucket to process, `my-prefix` is the file prefix to match, and `4` is the maximum number of workers of threads
